    <div class="paragraf px-3">
      <p>In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a
        single, universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and
        augmented reality (AR) headsets. In colloquial use, a metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on
        social connection.
        The term "metaverse" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta"
        and "universe." Metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to
        increasing demands for immersion. Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3, a concept
        for a decentralized iteration of the internet. Web3 and The Metaverse have been used as buzzwords to
        exaggerate development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes.
        Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within metaverses, stemming from challenges
        facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.
        Implementations
        Components of metaverse technology have already been developed within online video games. The 2003
        virtual world platform Second Life is often described as the first metaverse, as it incorporated many aspects
        of social media into a persistent three-dimensional world with the user represented as an avatar, however
        historical claims of metaverse development started soon after the term was coined. Early projects included
        Active Worlds and The Palace. Popular games described as part of the metaverse include Habbo Hotel, World of
        Warcraft, Minecraft, Fortnite, VRChat, and game creation platform Roblox which has since employed significant
        usage of the term in marketing. In a January 2022 interview with Wired, Second Life creator Philip Rosedale
        described metaverses as a three-dimensional Internet that is populated with live people. Social interaction
        and 3D virtual worlds are often an integral feature in many massively multiplayer online games.
        In 2019, the social network company Facebook launched a social VR world called Facebook Horizon. In 2021,
        Facebook was renamed "Meta Platforms" and its chairman Mark Zuckerberg declared a company commitment to
        developing a metaverse. Many of the virtual reality technologies advertised by Meta Platforms remain to be
        developed. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen criticised the move, adding that Meta Platforms' continued
        focus on growth-oriented projects is largely done to the detriment of ensuring safety on their platforms. Meta
        Platforms has also faced user safety criticism regarding Horizon Worlds due to the occurrence of sexual
        harassment on the platform. In 2021, Meta made a loss of over $10 billion on its metaverse development
        department, with Mark Zuckerberg saying he expects operating losses to “increase meaningfully” in 2022.
        In 2017, Microsoft acquired the VR company AltspaceVR, and has since implemented metaverse features such as
        virtual avatars and meetings held in virtual reality into Microsoft Teams.
        Proposed applications for metaverse technology include improving work productivity, interactive learning
        environments, e-commerce, real estate and fashion.

            <p class="p-5">User safety
              User addiction and problematic social media use is another concern. Internet addiction disorder, social
              media,
              and
              video game addiction can have mental and physical repercussions over a prolonged period of time, such as
              depression,
              anxiety, and various other harms related to having a sedentary lifestyle such as an increased risk for
              obesity
              and
              cardiovascular disease. Experts are also concerned that the metaverse could be used as an 'escape' from
              reality
              in a similar fashion to existing internet technologies.
